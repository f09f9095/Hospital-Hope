# Hospital Hope

Hospital Hope is a tool for searching through your local hospital's chargemaster for pricing. Hospitals must comply with [45 C.F.R. § 180.10 et. seq.](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-45/subtitle-A/subchapter-E/part-180) which states that hospitals are required to provide machine readable documents containing pricing information for medications, services, etc. Unfortunately, some hospitals do not meet this requirement.


### Note:
This is unfinished. It works, but chargemasters can vary a lot so it needs many parsers. See a small working example in [screens](https://github.com/f09f9095/Hospital-Hope#screens).


## To-do:
- [x] Hospital database and chargemaster links (Thanks to [payless.health](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/onefact/paylesshealth/doc/main))
- [x] Functioning front-end
- [ ] Parsers for different styles and file types
- [ ] Better downloader for difficult download links
- [ ] Prettier front-end
